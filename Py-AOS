    The theme for the 2016 AMS Annual Meeting, “Earth System Science in Service
    to Society”, weaves the many parts of AMS into a common core. Emphasizing
    the academic and research strength of AMS, the theme also connects that
    research to the benefits that society gains from our science. AMS merges the
    physical, chemical, and biological study of the Earth with human-centered
    “domains of action”: (1) Observing, (2) Analysis and research leading to
    understanding, (3) Modeling and prediction, and (4) Social sciences – how
    people deal with Earth. “Service to Society” explicitly evokes the
    integrated and complementary government and commercial enterprise that the
    AMS has done so much to foster over the last decade.  The 2016 meeting
    integrates AMS’ proud, nearly 100-year history of making a positive
    difference in the lives of our CITIZENS by continually communicating the
    advances of its science research to the public and policy makers.

    The application of high-performance computing, object-oriented programming,
    distributed computing, big data, and other advances in computer science to
    the atmospheric and oceanic sciences has, in turn, led to advances in
    modeling and analysis tools and methods. This symposium focuses on
    applications of the Python open-source language and seeks to disseminate
    advances using Python in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences, as well as
    grow the earth sciences Python community. Papers describing Python work in
    applications, methodologies, and package development in all areas of
    meteorology, climatology, oceanography, and space sciences are welcome,
    including (but not limited to): modeling, time series analysis, air quality,
    remote sensing applications, in-situ data analysis, GIS, Python as a
    software integration platform, visualization, gridding, model
    intercomparison, very large (terabyte) dataset manipulation and access, and
    learning and teaching Python. Following the overall annual meeting theme,
    the Symposium is also soliciting papers on advances in using Python related
    to delivering information regarding all aspects of the Earth system—weather,
    climate, hydrologic, etc.—in service to society.
